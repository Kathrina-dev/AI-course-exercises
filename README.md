# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains the exercises and projects I've completed while learning from **Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** course on YouTube.

Each project explores a key concept in artificial intelligence, ranging from search algorithms to optimization and machine learning.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1. **Maze Solver: DFS vs BFS**
- **Filename:** `maze.py`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the difference between **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** using a maze represented by `#` (walls) and spaces (paths).
- **Extras:** The solution path can be visualized using ASCII art or image output for clarity.

### 2. **Hospital Optimization**
- **Filename:** `hospital.py`
- **Description:** Solves an optimization problem where multiple houses are placed on a grid. The task is to find the optimal placement of a limited number of hospitals using **Random Restart Hill Climbing** to minimize average distance to the nearest hospital.
- **Concepts:** Search, optimization, heuristics.

### 3. **Banknote Authentication**
- **Filename:** `banknote.py`
- **Description:** Classifies banknotes as real or fake using **machine learning algorithms** (from `scikit-learn`).
- **Dataset:** Obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Banknote Authentication Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).
- **Techniques Used:** Training/test split, SVM (Support Vector Machines), accuracy analysis.
